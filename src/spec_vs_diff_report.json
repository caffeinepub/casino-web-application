  "summary": "Diff implements major parts of the requested scope: footer branding updated, lobby now renders from a backend-driven game catalog with fallback defaults, admin UI gains a Game Catalog tab/editor, backend adds game catalog storage and admin-only mutations, Blackjack and WheelSpin UIs appear updated toward card-face images and labeled wheel segments. One notable unrequested addition is support for adding brand-new catalog entries (not just editing existing ones).",
